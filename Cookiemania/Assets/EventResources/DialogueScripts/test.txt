# comments are designated with leading '#'
# key words are surrounded by '<' and '>'
# the triggering event (why an event starts) is a key word followed
# by the amount the game state must reach, so far: money, day, morality
# can also be a preceding event --> if an event is triggered by another 
# event ending, would be <end event_name> if triggered by another event
# starting, would be <start event_name> BUT using start should be a silent
# event (no dialogue, e.g. an invisible quest that the player doesn't know
# is happening) and end of course can be silent or whatever

# key words: event, choices, branch 1 (replace 1 with other numbers for 
# other choices), choice end, branch end, event end

# how to setup choice structure: 
# choice end comes after all the dialogue branches
# get tied back up for an event and branch end comes after each branches dialogue
# has ended (this allows e.g. branch 1 to have unique dialogue and also show branch 2's 
# dialogue after branch 1 dialogue is completed if branch 1 doesn't use the branch end key 
# word)
# event end exits the dialogue tree

# overall structure example --> event, trigger, dialogue, choice, branches, dialogue,
# choice, branches, branches, end

# each dialogue block needs to be preceeded by a character keyword, separate dialogue bubbles
# are given to each line e.g.
# chip
# > hello, how are you?
# > fine i hope?
# # Hello, how are you? and fine i hope? go in separate bubbles even though they'd fit in 
# # one line. Chat bubble limit is about 140 letters, so break up the monologues a bit.

# these are always minimum thresholds
# if negative need to reach a more/equal negative point to meet trigger condition
