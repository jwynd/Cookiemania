//game UI texts, TUTORIAL marks it as a tutorial line, END as a post game line
//can extend this to debug lines too
//dont use ":" in your lines
//cs creates hashtables from this text file to display on screen
//uses html tags normally, things like <Horizontal> are input axes
//second column tells what should be replaced in the <REPLACE> command
//and also what array position and the requirements to go to next command
//second number for non input required lines is the timer til the text is replaced
//by the next text line
//ANYTHING IN BRACKETS THAT ISNT AN HTML SUBSCRIPT NEEDS TO BE IN THE CS
//current axes used: Horizontal Jump Pickup Throw
TUTORIAL:<Horizontal>:press <REPLACE_NEGATIVE> to go left and <REPLACE_POSITIVE> to go right
TUTORIAL:<Jump>:now press <REPLACE_POSITIVE> to jump
TUTORIAL:3:watch out!<br>platforms fall apart after jumping onto them
TUTORIAL:3:but to progress, you gotta jump!
TUTORIAL:<Pickup>:press <REPLACE_POSITIVE> to pickup bombs!
TUTORIAL:<Throw>:if you have a bomb, you can press <REPLACE_POSITIVE> to throw that bomb
//when tutorial lines completed tutorial object should replace itself
//both good and bad should map to the number of coins made in the level
//AND which array position to place/retrieve the line in
END:<good>:LEVEL COMPLETE!<br>you made <REPLACE_POSITIVE> coins
END:<bad>:Game Over...<br>you made <REPLACE_POSITIVE> coins
